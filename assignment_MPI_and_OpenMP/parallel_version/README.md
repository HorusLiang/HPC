# Future directions
srun can be applied. ( in job.sh )
#SBATCH --nodes=16 ( how to change this parameter value in a loop?)
why [ $tasks -ge $nodes ] received no result?
why OpenMP code has no effect?
how to use OpenMp to optimize inner loops(if there is two loops?)
map can change the type from int to uint8 to reduce the requirement of memory, assume can have a great impact.
